Description: Implements the algorithm describe in <paper doi>. The algorithm is designed to fit Voigt profiles to signals gathered from Raman Spectroscopy.
             By default a linear function is used to fit the background if needed it can be extended with BSplines or any other set of fixed positive functions.
             Parameter initialization is not required, but can be optionally added. The algorithm can fit 30 peaks in roughly a minute.
