Description: Implements the algorithm described in <paper doi>. The algorithm is designed to fit Voigt profiles to Raman Spectroscopy signals.
             Parameter initialization is not required, but can be optionally added. The algorithm can fit 30 peaks in roughly a minute.
             By default a linear function is used to fit the background if needed it can be extended with BSplines or any other set of fixed positive functions.
